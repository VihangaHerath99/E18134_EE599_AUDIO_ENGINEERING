<!-- Activity 03 -->
> ### Activity 3: Learn About Different Sound Formats  

#### **1. Dolby Atmos**
- Dolby Atmos is an advanced audio format that creates an immersive sound experience. Unlike traditional surround sound systems, which are channel-based (e.g., 5.1 or 7.1 systems), Dolby Atmos is object-based. This means that sound can be placed and moved anywhere in a three-dimensional space, including above the listener, for a more realistic and enveloping audio experience. It is widely used in cinemas and increasingly in home theater systems and even on mobile devices and headphones.  

#### **2. Surround Sound (5.1, 7.1)**

- *5.1 Surround Sound:* This format uses six channels – five for normal speakers (left, right, center, left surround, right surround) and one for the subwoofer (the ".1" for low-frequency effects).  

- *7.1 Surround Sound:* Expands upon 5.1 by adding two additional speakers (left back and right back) for a more immersive experience.  

#### **3. Auro-3D**

- Auro-3D adds a vertical axis to traditional surround sound systems, creating a more three-dimensional soundscape. It typically involves an additional height layer of speakers above the existing surround sound layout. 

#### **4. Ambisonics**

- A full-sphere surround sound technique that captures sound in all directions (including above and below the listener). It is used in VR (virtual reality) and other immersive environments to create a truly three-dimensional audio experience.
