## Activities

<!-- - Activity 01 -->
> ### Activity 1: Select five commercially used microphones and compare their frequency responses.

#### **1. Shure SM58**

![Activity01_001](<images/Activity01_001.png>)  

**Type:** Dynamic  

**Frequency Response:** 50 Hz to 15 kHz  

**Characteristics:**
- Tailored frequency response with a presence boost in the midrange, particularly around 2-5 kHz.
- Roll-off at low frequencies to reduce handling noise and proximity effect.
- Well-suited for live vocals and speeches due to its robust build and clear midrange.

#### **2. Neumann U87**

![Activity01_002](<images/Activity01_002.png>)  

**Type:** Condenser

**Frequency Response:** 20 Hz to 20 kHz
