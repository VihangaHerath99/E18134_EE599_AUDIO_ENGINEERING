## Activities

> ### Activity 1: Select five commercially used microphones and compare their frequency responses.

#### **1. Shure SM58**

![Activity01_001](<images/Activity01_001.png>)  

**Type:** Dynamic  

**Frequency Response:** 50 Hz to 15 kHz  

**Characteristics:**
- Tailored frequency response with a presence boost in the midrange, particularly around 2-5 kHz.
- Roll-off at low frequencies to reduce handling noise and proximity effect.
- Well-suited for live vocals and speeches due to its robust build and clear midrange.

#### **2. Neumann U87**

![Activity01_002](<images/Activity01_002.png>)  

**Type:** Condenser

**Frequency Response:** 20 Hz to 20 kHz

**Characteristics:**
- Flat frequency response with a slight boost around 8 kHz for added presence.
- Switchable high-pass filter at 80 Hz to reduce low-frequency noise.
- Known for its versatility, suitable for vocals, instruments, and broadcast.


#### **3. Audio-Technica AT2020**

![Activity01_003](<images/Activity01_003.png>)

**Type:** Condenser

**Frequency Response:** 20 Hz to 20 kHz

**Characteristics:**
- Relatively flat frequency response with a slight high-end lift above 10 kHz.
- Low-mass diaphragm for extended frequency response and transient response.
- Popular for home studios, offering good clarity and detail for vocals and instruments.

#### **4. Rode NT1-A**

![Activity01_004](<images/Activity01_004.png>)

**Type:** Condenser

**Frequency Response:** 20 Hz to 20 kHz

**Characteristics:**
- Flat frequency response with a gentle boost around 10 kHz for clarity and presence.
- Very low self-noise, making it ideal for quiet recording environments.
- Widely used for vocals, acoustic instruments, and voice-overs due to its detailed sound.

#### **5. AKG C414**

![Activity01_005](<images/Activity01_005.png>)

**Type:** Condenser

**Frequency Response:** 20 Hz to 20 kHz

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple frequency response settings with several switchable polar patterns.
- Slight presence boost around 4-10 kHz and a selectable high-pass filter.
- Highly versatile, used in studios for a wide range of applications including vocals, instruments, and room recording.
